# iMessage Clone

This is the iMessage Clone - A real-time messaging project that was built using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), it also uses [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com) to make this application look great and speed up our development by using the components on the fly, [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) and [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com) to manage requests to the backend in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and database [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) with the help of the ORM [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) to make the handling of all the usernames, user data like messages, login, logout sessions and so on, much easier and maintainable.

This iMessage clone had some changes and personal touches not to be a perfect copy, so I can add a little bit of changes in the styling.
